Tesla had its first Battery Day on September 22nd, 2020[^1]. What a fantastic world
we live in that we can witness the first Apple-like keynote for batteries.
Batteries are a part of our everyday life; without them, the world would be
a much different place. Your cellphone, flashlight, tablet, laptops, drones,
cars, and other devices would not be portable and operational without batteries.

At the heart of it, batteries store chemical energy and convert it into
electrical energy. The chemical reaction in a battery involves the flow of
electrons from one electrode to another. When a battery is discharging,
electrons flow from the electrode known as the anode, or negative electrode, to
the electrode known as the cathode, or positive electrode. This flow of
electrons provides an electric current that can be used to power devices.
Electrons have a negative charge; therefore, as the flow of negative electrons
moves from one electrode to another, an electrolyte is used to balance the
charge by being the route for charge-balancing positive ions to flow.

Let’s break this process down a bit and uncover the chemical reactions at play
within batteries. To have an electrical current, we need a flow of electrons.
Where do those electrons come from? 

Electrons in the anode are produced by a chemical reaction between the anode, or
negative electrode, and the electrolyte. Simultaneously, another chemical
reaction occurs in the cathode, or positive electrode, enabling it to accept
electrons. Through these chemical reactions, a flow of electrons is created,
resulting in an electrical current. 

A chemical reaction that involves the exchange of electrons is known as
a reduction-oxidation reaction, or redox reaction.  Reduction refers to a gain
of electrons. Thus, half of this reaction, defined as reduction, occurs at the
cathode because it gains electrons. Oxidation refers to a loss of electrons.
Therefore, half of this reaction, defined as oxidation, occurs at the anode
because it loses electrons to the cathode.  Each of these reactions, reduction
and oxidation, has a particular standard potential. An electrochemical cell can
be made up of any two conducting materials that have reactions with different
standard potentials since the more robust material, which makes up the cathode,
will gain electrons from the weaker material, which makes up the anode. 

Batteries can be made up of one or more electrochemical cells, each cell
consisting of one anode, one cathode, and an electrolyte, as described above.
The electrodes and electrolyte are generally made up of different types of
metals or other chemical compounds. Different materials for the electrodes and
electrolyte produce different chemical reactions that affect how the battery
works, how much energy it can store, and its voltage.  

### Volts 

The word “volt”
refers to the measure of electric potential. The term came from the Italian
scientist Alessandro Volta, who is credited for inventing the first battery. In
1780, Luigi Galvani, another Italian scientist, observed that the legs of frogs
hanging on iron or brass hooks would twitch when touched with a probe of some
other type of metal. Galvani believed that this was caused by electricity from
within the frogs’ tissues. He called it ‘animal electricity.’

Volta believed the electric current came from the two different metal types: the
hooks on which the frogs were hanging and the probe's different metal. He
thought the current was merely being transmitted through, not from, the frogs’
tissues. Volta experimented with stacks of silver and zinc layers interspersed
with layers of cloth or paper soaked in saltwater and found an electric current
flowed through a wire applied to both ends of the pile. Volta also found that
the amount of voltage could be increased by using different metals in the pile.
Leading to what we know today as the scientific unit of a "volt[^2]."

There are two ways to increase a battery's voltage: stack several cells together
or increase the cell's electrochemical potential by choosing different
materials. 

When cells are combined in a series, it has an additive effect on the battery’s
voltage. Essentially, the force at which the electrons move through the battery
can be seen as the total force as it moves from the first cell's anode through
the number of cells the battery contains to the last cell’s cathode.  

In contrast, when cells are combined in parallel, it increases the battery’s
possible current, which is defined as the total number of electrons flowing
through the cells, but not its voltage.  

### Measuring electricity 

When you buy
a light bulb, the box indicates the wattage for the bulb. Watts are
a measurement of power. Watts describe the rate of electricity that is being
used at a specific moment. Therefore, a 60-watt light bulb uses 60 watts of
electricity at any moment while turned on.

Watt-hours (Wh), on the other hand, are a measurement of energy. Watt-hours
describe the total amount of electricity used over time. You can derive from the
name that watt-hours are a combination of watts, the rate electricity is used,
and hours, the length of time used.  Going back to our example, a 60-watt light
bulb that draws 60 watts of electricity at any moment while turned on uses 60
watt-hours of electricity over one hour.

Watt-hours will only get you so far, however. If you want to measure the
electricity used by a large appliance or a household, folks tend to use
kilowatt-hours (kWh). A kilowatt is equal to one thousand watts; therefore, one
kilowatt-hour is equal to one thousand watt-hours.

If you want to measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity
used by an entire city, you will use megawatts. A megawatt is one thousand
kilowatts or one million watts. Getting even larger, a gigawatt is one thousand
megawatts, or one million kilowatts, or one billion watts. Gigawatts is where
the namesake for Tesla’s Gigafactories comes from. In 2018, battery production
at the Gigafactory in Nevada reached 20 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year[^3].  

### Alkaline batteries 

Most people are probably familiar with alkaline batteries. These are
the batteries that you typically use to power toys, electronics, flashlights,
etc. The bulk of alkaline batteries produced are single-use, although there are
some rechargeable alkaline batteries in existence. So what makes up an alkaline
battery? 

Alkaline batteries have zinc as their anode and manganese dioxide
(MnO<sub>2</sub>) as
their cathode. Their name, however, comes from the alkaline solution used as the
electrolyte. The electrolyte is typically potassium hydroxide (KOH), which can
contain a large number of dissolved ions. The more ions the electrolyte solution
can absorb, the longer the redox reaction that drives the battery can keep
going.

The zinc anode is usually in powdered form. Powder has a greater surface area
for a reaction, which means the cell can quickly release its power. The zinc
anode gives up its electrons to the manganese dioxide cathode, to which carbon,
in the form of graphite, is added to improve its conductivity and help it keep
its shape.

Alkaline batteries are popular because they have a low self-discharge rate,
giving them a long shelf life, and don’t contain toxic heavy metals like lead or
cadmium. They account for the bulk of batteries that are made today, although
their place at the top will likely soon be challenged by the lithium-ion
batteries in our phones, laptops, cars, and an increasing number of other
gadgets.  

### Lithium-ion batteries 

Lithium-ion batteries are popular due to their
energy density. Because the energy is dense, your phone can last all day and
still be the small, portable, handheld device we are all familiar with. As you
likely know from the behavior of your phone, lithium-ion batteries are
rechargeable. The namesake for the battery comes from the fact that lithium ions
(Li+) are involved in the chemical reactions that make up the battery. 

In a lithium-ion cell, both electrodes, anode and cathode, are made of materials
that can absorb lithium ions. The absorbing action is known as intercalation
when charged ions of an element can be stored inside a material without
significantly disturbing it. The lithium ions are paired to an electron within
the structure of the anode. When the battery discharges, the intercalated
lithium ions are released from the anode and travel through the electrolyte
solution to be intercalated in the cathode.

A lithium-ion battery starts its life in a state of full discharge: all its
lithium ions are intercalated within the cathode, and its chemistry cannot yet
produce any electricity. Before the battery can be used, it needs to be charged.
As the battery is charged, an oxidation reaction occurs at the cathode, meaning
that it loses some negatively charged electrons. An equal number of positively
charged intercalated lithium ions are dissolved into the electrolyte solution to
maintain the charge balance in the cathode. These travel over to the anode,
where they are intercalated, or absorbed, within what is typically graphite.
This intercalation reaction also deposits electrons into the graphite anode, to
pair with the lithium ion.  There are many other types of batteries, but you
mostly need to understand lithium-ion batteries as context for this article[^4].

## New technologies 

### Solid-state batteries 

Counter to the liquid or polymer gel
electrolyte found in batteries today, solid-state batteries use a solid
electrolyte and solid electrodes. If we recall from earlier, positive ions flow
through the electrolyte to balance the electrons' negative charge. Today,
batteries are quite efficient at transferring positive ions since a liquid
electrolyte is in contact with the electrodes' entire surface area. Using
a solid makes this a bit harder. Imagine the difference between dipping a chip
in soup and dipping it into chopped tomatoes. The chip dipped in the soup will
have soup covering more of the chip's surface area than the chopped tomatoes
cover the other chip.

So why even use a solid electrolyte if it is less efficient? Today’s lithium-ion
batteries typically rely on flammable liquids as the electrolyte. By using
a solid electrolyte, batteries can be less prone to catching fire. Most folks
probably remember Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, which had the unfortunate side effect
of catching fire[^5]. Solid electrolytes provide a much safer alternative.

Research and experimentation in solid electrolytes typically tend to be either
solid polymers at high temperatures or ceramics at room temperature. The
downside of solid polymers at high temperatures is they need to operate at
temperatures above 220°F (105°C)[^6]. That is certainly not practical for a handheld
device like a phone or tablet, but could be apt for storing energy to power
a home. 

Quite a few companies are working on using ceramics at room temperature to
create a solid-state battery. Toyota has been talking about theirs for years[^7] and
aims to have it completed in 2025[^8]. Startups, such as [Solid Power](https://solidpowerbattery.com/) and 
[A123 Systems (with the help of Iconic Materials)](https://ionicmaterials.com/2019/06/a123-systems-and-ionic-materials-advance-all-solid-state-battery-development-using-solid-polymer-electrolyte-with-conventional-lithium-ion-electrodes/), 
aim to do the same.

A lot of the novel research being done on solid-state batteries is the work of
Jürgen Janek[^9]. Jürgen recently published a benchmark of the performance of
all-solid-state lithium batteries[^10]. Another high-profile battery scientist,
Gerbrand Ceder, published a paper on interface stability in solid-state
batteries[^11]. New and novel research on solid-state batteries is being published
quite frequently. While there are many skeptics of solid-state batteries since
it has yet to be commercially delivered and scaled, I would not dismiss it
entirely from having a seat at the table in the future.  

### Nuclear batteries 

Until
now, we have only discussed batteries powered by chemical reactions, such as
those powering flashlights, phones, and other gadgets. Chemical batteries, also
known as galvanic cells, discharge in a given amount of time and either need to
be thrown away or recharged. Begging the question: is there a type of battery
that could last long term?

Nuclear batteries, also known as atomic batteries, using the energy of beta
decay, are being researched to create a battery that lasts longer than those
powered by chemical reactions. Batteries powered by beta decay are known as
betavoltaics. Radioactive isotopes used in nuclear batteries have half-lives
ranging from tens to hundreds of years, so their power output remains nearly
constant for a very long time. If nuclear batteries last from tens to hundreds
of years, why are we not using them everywhere today? Doesn’t everyone want
a phone that could last at least ten years without needing to be charged?

There are a few side effects of nuclear batteries. They cannot be turned off;
electrons are continually being produced, even when they are not needed.
Research is being done into stimulating beta decay[^12], which would create more
current on-demand, allowing the output to drop to almost nothing when it is
turned off. Another downside is the power density of betavoltaic cells is much
lower than that of chemical batteries. However, it is interesting to note that
betavoltaics were used in the 1970s to power cardiac pacemakers, before being
replaced by cheaper lithium-ion batteries, even though lithium-ion batteries
have a shorter lifetime.

In 2016, Russian researchers from MISIS presented a prototype betavoltaic
battery based on nickel-63[^13]. A downside of using nickel-63 is that it is not
readily available, making their research hard to commercialize. CityLabs sells
a betavoltaic battery, with a 14.4-year half-life, you can buy today starting at
$1,000[^14], but you would need 1.2 million of these just to have one watt of power.
[NDB](https://ndb.technology/) is a startup working on a nano diamond battery that could last for thousands
of years[^15]. [UPower](http://www.upowertech.com/) is another startup working on a megawatt-scale atomic
generator.  

### Silicon anode 

Today, the material typically used for the anode is
graphite because it is economical, reliable, and relatively energy-dense,
especially compared to current cathode materials. The limiting factor of
lithium-ion batteries is the amount of lithium that can be stored in the
electrodes. Using silicon as the material for the anode, rather than graphite,
allows around nine times more lithium ions to be held in the anode. 

The ability to store more lithium ions using silicon sounds amazing; why isn’t
everyone doing this? The problem is a silicon anode swells to 3-4 times its
original volume when it absorbs lithium ions. Making the casing bigger doesn’t
circumvent the problem because the expansion causes the silicon to fracture,
causing the battery to fail. It also gums up with a passivation layer, also
known as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), formed on electrode surfaces
from the decomposition of electrolytes. 

> “With silicon, the cookie crumbles and gets gooey.” - Elon Musk.

As a solution to this problem, many companies use silicon as a fraction of the
anode material. But these materials are expensive and highly engineered.
Examples of this include silicon structured in SiO glass ($6.6 per kWh), silicon
structured in graphite ($10.2 per kWh), and silicon nanowires (>$100 per
kWh)[^16].
[Sila Nanotechnologies](https://silanano.com/) is using silicon as their anode material[^17]. 
[Amprius](https://www.amprius.com/technology/) claims
to use silicon for 100% the anode material with silicon nanowires, a highly
engineered, expensive material. [Advano](https://www.advano.io/), 
[Enevate](https://www.enevate.com/), and [Enovix](https://enovix.com/) are startups working
on a silicon solution for the anode material.  

### Tesla’s Battery Day 

At Tesla’s
Battery Day event, they announced many changes to their battery that encompass
more than just the materials used. Tesla has on staff one of the most renowned
battery scientists, Jeff Dahn. His most recent papers on “A Wide Range of
Testing Results on an Excellent Lithium-Ion Cell Chemistry to be used as
Benchmarks for New Battery Technologies[^18]” and “Is Cobalt Needed in Ni-rich
Positive Electrode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries?[^19]” help gives some insight
into what Tesla has been working on.

The battery day outcomes increase their vehicles’ range while being more
economical; they plan to halve the cost per kilowatt-hour. Most startups[^20] in this
space tend to take a single design decision into account for their products, for
example, anode material and focus on that. Tesla, on the other hand, took a very
well rounded approach. They took into account not only the materials for the
cathode and anode but also the cell design, factory, and integration with the
vehicle[^21].

![vert-integration](/img/vert-integration.jpg)

Let’s break down each of these improvements.  

#### Cell design 

For Tesla’s batteries,
while discharging, the positive ions flow over the tabs, while the lithium ions
flow from the anode to the cathode, as shown below. The tabs allow the cell’s
energy to be transferred to an external source.

![cell-flow](/img/cell-flow.png)

> Source: Tesla’s Battery Day Presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T9xIeZTds

The Tesla team sought out to increase the cell size to 46 millimeters, which
optimizes vehicle range and cost reduction. However, increasing the cells' size
has a negative side effect on supercharging because of thermal issues. To
circumvent these issues, the Tesla team removed the tabs, calling their new
design tabless.

The tabless design leads to simpler manufacturing, fewer parts, and a five times
reduction in the electrical path. Going from 250-millimeter to 50-millimeter
electrical path length leads to substantial thermal benefits. The electrical
path length is significant because the distance the electron has to travel is
much less. Even though the cell is much bigger, the power to weight ratio is
better than a smaller cell with tabs. 

![tabless](/img/tabless.png)

> Source: Tesla’s Battery Day Presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T9xIeZTds

Let’s dive into why this new tabless design matters. Instead of calling it
tabless, Tesla could have called it “many tabs” because each of the folded pins
is a tab, as shown in the image above. What is the function of a tab?

Growing up, my family would always leave sporting events before they ended to
avoid the crowd trying to leave the stadium after the event was over. If we had
stayed to the end of the event, it would take more time for us to exit the
stadium and be very uncomfortable since everyone would be trying to leave
through very few exits at the same time. As people are trying to exit, they get
closer and closer to one another, and the environment becomes very hot and
rowdy. If we think of people as electrons, a stadium with a single exit is
similar to a battery’s behavior with a single tab; electrons are all trying to
leave through the single tab and bumping up against one another until they heat
up. There are multiple tabs in Tesla’s new design, equivalent to a stadium with
lots of exits. Now people, or electrons, can exit quickly while staying cool and
calm.

There aren’t many details from the presentation on the new tabless design and
its implementation, but it can be attributed to “secret sauce.”

Manufacturing a cell consists of an electrode process where the active materials
are coated into films onto foils; the coated foils are then wound in the winding
process. The roll is then assembled into the can, sealed, and filled with
electrolyte and then sent to Formation where the cell is charged for the first
time. If you recall from above, a lithium-ion battery starts its life in
a discharged state. For a battery cell with tabs, manufacturing is much more
complicated because winding and coating are dramatically simplified. When the
cell with tabs is going through the assembly line, it has to keep stopping where
all the tabs are so you can’t do continuous motion production. It is also a lot
more error-prone.

> “It is really a huge pain in the ass to have tabs from a production standpoint.” - Elon Musk.

The new batteries are 46 millimeters by 80 millimeters, leading to the name
4680. The first two digits refer to the diameter, and the second two digits
refer to the length. Previously, an extra zero was added onto the end of the
name, but it was removed since it had no purpose. 

The 4680 batteries have five times more energy with six times the power and
enable a 16% range increase. At the battery pack level, the form factor
improvements alone lead to a 14% reduction in cost per kWh.  

#### Cell factory 

We
learned a bit about how removing tabs from the battery cells simplified the
manufacturing process above. In an assembly line, you don’t want things to stop
and start but continuously move. Any time the process is stopped leads to
inefficiency. The Tesla team aims to speed up its process to make one factory
have multiple scales of efficiency better than a typical battery factory.

We learned above that the electrode process is where the active materials are
coated into films onto foils. The wet process step of the electrode process
consists of first: mixing. Mixing occurs when the powders are mixed with either
water or a solvent, typically a solvent for the cathode. The mix then goes into
a large coat and dry oven, tens of meters long, where the slurry is coated onto
the foil and dried. The solvent then has to be recovered. Finally, the coated
foil is compressed to the final density. This process is complex and
inefficient, especially since humans need to transport the mix from the mixing
step to the ovens. It is also inefficient due to the need to put the solvent in
and then recover it.

One significant change they are making is skipping the solvent step of the
electrode coating's wet process in favor of a dry process. The dry process
transforms the powder directly into film. This technology initially stemmed from
Tesla’s acquisition of Maxwell at the beginning of 2019[^22]. At battery day, Elon
mentioned that since the acquisition, they are now on the 4th revision of the
equipment that turns powder into film. Elon noted, “there is still a lot of work
to do. There is a clear path to success but a ton of work between here and
there.” When this process is scaled up, it results in a ten times reduction in
footprint and a ten times reduction in energy, and a massive decrease in CapEx
investment.

The manufacturing step known as Formation is where the cell is charged for the
first time, and the quality of the cell is verified. Formation is typically 25%
of the CapEx investment. The Tesla team improved density and cost-effectiveness
by using their knowledge from cars and the powerwall charging and discharging.
This led to a 86% reduction in Formation CapEx investment per GWh and a 75%
reduction in footprint. For a factory that previously output 150 GWh, this
translates to that same factory outputting 1 TWh with the more efficient
processes. At the battery pack level, this leads to an 18% reduction in cost per
kWh.  

#### Anode material 

Tesla announced they were moving to silicon as their anode
material. Silicon is excellent because it is the most abundant element in the
earth’s crust after oxygen. Rather than creating a highly engineered material
that would be expensive, Tesla will use the raw silicon found in the earth’s
crust and design for it to expand. They will stabilize the silicon's surface
through an elastic, ion-conducting polymer coating and a highly elastic binder
and electrolyte.

Tesla’s silicon costs $1.20 per kWh, whereas the solutions we covered earlier
cost anywhere from $6 per kWh to upwards of a hundred. Using silicon leads to
a 5% reduction in cost per kWh at the battery pack level and a 20% longer range
for Tesla vehicles.  

#### Cathode material 

A helpful analogy for understanding the
cathode is to think of the cathode as a bookshelf. In this case, the lithium
ions would be books. The most efficient bookshelf holds the most books while
still being stable enough to retain its structure as the books get loaned out
and returned. 


![tesla-cathode](/img/tesla-cathode.png)

> Source: Tesla’s Battery Day Presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T9xIeZTds

The Tesla team aims to increase Nickel in its cathode material since it is the
cheapest and has the highest energy density (as shown above). Cobalt is
typically used as a cathode material because it is very stable. However, the
Tesla team aims to leverage novel coatings and dopants to stabilize Nickel
better and remove Cobalt entirely from their materials. Removing Cobalt leads to
a 15% reduction in the cathode’s cost per kWh. 

The Tesla team made sure to keep in mind the cost of the materials used and the
materials’ availability. With silicon for the anode material, availability was
not an issue since silicon is readily available. The same goes for lithium,
which is also highly accessible. For Nickel, on the other hand, the Tesla team
is keeping in mind total Nickel availability by diversifying the amount of
Nickel they are using per the type of vehicle. 

The team also simplified the cathode manufacturing process by removing all the
legacy parts. According to the battery day presentation, the cathode
manufacturing process, which is 35% of the cathode cost per kWh, had not had
a fresh look in a long time and was wildly inefficient. 

> “If you take a look at the ‘it’s a small world journey’ of I am a Nickel atom
> and what happens to me, it’s crazy, you’re going around the world three times,
> there is a moral equivalent of digging the ditch, filling in the ditch, and
> digging the ditch again. It’s total madness.” - Elon Musk.

A typical cathode process starts with the metal from the mine being turned into
an intermediate material called metal sulfate, which, in turn, is processed
again. The Tesla team removed the intermediate step of turning the metal into
metal sulfate along with a bunch of other unnecessary steps. They also
localized the cathode materials to the US, which decreased the number of miles
required for the materials to travel. This leads to a 66% reduction in CapEx
investment, a 76% reduction in process cost, and zero wastewater. The cathode
material improvements lead to a 12% reduction in cost per kWh at the battery
pack level.  

#### Cell vehicle integration 

In the early days of aircraft, the fuel
was carried as cargo. Later, the fuel tanks were made in wing shape. This was
a breakthrough because the wings are critical to the airplane's function but now
could be used for another purpose. The fuel tank was no longer cargo but
fundamental to the structure of the aircraft. Tesla intends to do the same for
cars.

By removing the intermediate structure in the battery pack, they can pack the
cells more densely. Instead of having supports and stabilizers in the battery
cells, making up the intermediate structural elements, the battery pack itself
is structural. Typically, Tesla fills the battery packs with a flame retardant.
The new battery packs will be filled with a flame retardant and structural
adhesive, giving it stiffness and stability without intermediate structural
elements. This makes the structure even stiffer than a regular car. 

The cells can now be moved more towards the center of the vehicle because the
volumetric efficiency is better, avoiding a side impact potentially contacting
the cells. This also allows the car to maneuver better because the polar moment
of inertia is improved. Much like an ice skater can turn better with her arms
close to her body rather than extended out.

The improvements to the battery pack integration lead to a 10% mass reduction in
the car's body, a 14% range increase, and 370 fewer parts. The smaller,
integrated battery and body also help increase the efficiency of manufacturing.
This leads to a 55% reduction in CapEx investment and a 35% reduction in floor
space. At the battery pack level, the integration improvements lead to a 7%
reduction in cost per kWh.

The sum of all these improvements, including cell design, factory, materials,
and vehicle integration, achieves the goal to halve the cost per kWh. Cheaper
electric vehicles widen Tesla’s market to new buyers reducing the number of
gas-powered vehicles on the road.  

## Summary

All in all, it is fantastic to see
a technology we all rely on day to day get its time in the spotlight. Although
not mentioned at battery day, if Tesla were to achieve 400 watt-hours per
kilogram, a zero-emissions jet might just be on the horizon. Now that batteries
are vertically integrated into Tesla’s product, you can only imagine that the
software will track more data on battery efficiency, leading to more and more
improvements in the future. 

It is incredible to see Tesla take a fresh look at making the most efficient and
cost-effective batteries. The level of thought and detail put into rethinking
old processes from first principles to make them more efficient is inspiring.
The Tesla team didn’t just look at one angle, but all the angles: cell design,
manufacturing, vehicle integration, and materials. There is a clear “why” for
every decision made that boils down to economics, not just technical gains.
Hopefully, we see another core technology, such as batteries, in the spotlight
soon.
