[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is the hip, new way to VPN :P

No, but seriously I wanted to try it out because it is super interesting and
I think the direction it is going is awesome. Read about it 
[on their website](https://www.wireguard.com/#about-the-project) if
you have not already.

What is cool about Wireguard is it integrates into the Linux
networking stack so you have a lot of power over interactions with it. In other
words, it is very easy to clone the interface into specific containers. Or
just use it on your host.

If you are new to my blog, I HATEEEE installing things on my host. I run
everything in containers. Wireguard is a kernel module. BUT guess what,
literally anything can be run in a container. This post is going
to go over how to install the Wireguard module by using a container and how to
run the tools from a container as well.

**UPDATE (April 2020):** You might want to use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). It is simple to install 
and cross platform since it uses the go implementation of wireguard. Then you don't have to 
mess with the kernel!

I will never forget this thread from 2017 ;) so glad to see the go implementation happen!

## Installing

I wrote a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/wireguard/install/Dockerfile)
for installing the kernel module.

You can run it with:

```console
$ docker run --rm -it \
 	--name wireguard \
 	-v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
 	-v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
 	r.j3ss.co/wireguard:install
```

This only works if you have your kernel headers installed in `/usr/src` and 
your kernel allows kernel modules (`CONFIG_MODULES=y`).

If you are like me and set `CONFIG_MODULES=n` then you can use my 
[kernel-builder Dockerfile](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/kernel-builder/Dockerfile)
to build a custom kernel.

```console
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -v /usr/src:/usr/src \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    -v /boot:/boot \
    --name kernel-builder \
    r.j3ss.co/kernel-builder
```

That will pop you into a bash shell where you can run the following 
[build script](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/kernel-builder/build_kernel)
to build a specific kernel version.

```console
# build_kernel 4.17.1
```

That saves the `vmlinuz` to `/boot` where you can then update your initramfs
for the new image and add it to your bootloader if needed.

## Using the tools

`wg` is the command for interacting with Wireguard. You can learn more about it
in their [docs](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/#command-line-interface).

I put the tools in a container and added a bash alias for them:

```console
$ type wg
wg is a function
wg () 
{ 
    docker run -it --rm --log-driver none -v /tmp:/tmp --cap-add NET_ADMIN --net host --name wg r.j3ss.co/wg "$@"
}
```

Then you can run the following commands to try sending some packets through
Wireguard. The below steps come from the 
[following script](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/plain/contrib/examples/ncat-client-server/client.sh)
which is `Copyright (C) 2015-2018 Jason A. Donenfeld. All Rights Reserved. GPL-2.0`.
I merely added comments for the steps.

```console
$ export WG_PRIVATE_KEY="$(wg genkey)"

# open file descriptior 3 with some initial details
# this is just wireguard's demo server, you can use the container to spin up
# your own, don't actually use this as your server
$ exec 3<>/dev/tcp/demo.wireguard.com/42912

$ wg pubkey <<<"$WG_PRIVATE_KEY" >&3

$ IFS=: read -r status server_pubkey server_port internal_ip <&3

# make sure the status is "OK"
$ echo $status
OK

# delete the link if you already had one
$ sudo ip link del dev wg0 || true

# create the wireguard link
$ sudo ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard

# save the private key to a temporary file
# obviously in a real world scenario we wouldn't be throwing these around
# all willy nilly
$ echo "$WG_PRIVATE_KEY" > /tmp/wg-privatekey

# configure the interface
$ wg set wg0 private-key /tmp/wg-privatekey peer "$server_pubkey" allowed-ips 0.0.0.0/0 endpoint "demo.wireguard.com:$server_port" persistent-keepalive 25

# assign an ip address/peer
$ sudo -E ip address add "$internal_ip"/24 dev wg0

# bring the interface up
$ sudo ip link set up dev wg0

# make it the default route
$ export WG_HOST="$(wg show wg0 endpoints | sed -n 's/.*\t\(.*\):.*/\1/p')"

# add the routes
$ sudo -E ip route add $(ip route get $WG_HOST | sed '/ via [0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}/{s/^\(.* via [0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\).*/\1/}' | head -n 1)
$ sudo ip route add 0/1 dev wg0
$ sudo ip route add 128/1 dev wg0
```

Test it is routing!

```console
$ curl https://httpbin.j3ss.co/ip
{"origin":"163.172.161.0"}
```

And that's all. Just thought it was kinda fun using this and now it is very
easy to install :)
