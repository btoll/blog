WE STARTED A COMPUTER COMPANY!! You have no idea how long I've been waiting to 
say that! I guess some context would help... 
[Steve Tuck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-tuck-02b4313/), 
[Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill), and I officially started the 
[Oxide Computer Company](https://oxide.computer). Since then, we've been 
working on closing up fundraising, getting an awesome office, and hiring! 

You are probably thinking "a computer company? that's outrageous!".. well it 
is and it isn't. Over the last year, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of 
time talking with folks who are currently running workloads on premises. The 
consensus from all my conversations has been that everyone setting up 
infrastructure themselves is in a great deal of pain and they have been 
largely neglected by any existing vendor. All these folks have very good 
reasons for running on premises that include security, strategic reasons like 
latency, specialized workloads, or the reality that the unit economics of 
running at their scale in the cloud are unsustainable.

I've had the privilege of working on projects in my career that have had a 
positive impact on a lot of people -- from Docker, to the Go programming 
language, to Kubernetes. Over the course of talking to folks, I soon realized 
that working on solving the pain for those running on premises would have a 
huge amount of impact. Hyperscalers like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have 
what I like to call "infrastructure privilege" since they long ago decided they 
could build their own hardware and software to fulfill their needs better than 
commodity vendors. We are working to bring that same infrastructure privilege 
to everyone else! This leads to better integration between the hardware and 
software stacks, better power distribution, and better density. It's even 
better for the environment due to the energy consumption wins!

I can't think of a better problem space and group of folks to work with to 
build a company. I’ve known both Bryan and Steve from the container conference 
circuit and couldn’t pass up an opportunity to work with both of them. I've 
also been in love with computers since I was a child… as proof of this (not 
that it’s needed) here is a very early diary entry of mine.

In typical cliche computer company fashion we have been working out of my 
garage. Bryan brought over his collection of computer manuals and even added 
to my collection of floppy disks. It's basically been a computer nerd’s 
nirvana!

Since we now have funding, we will be moving to a bigger space. I can't wait; 
I fell in love the minute we saw it. It's perfect for a nascent computer 
company to grow.

We will still be using the original garage to record episodes of 
[On the Metal](https://oxide.computer/blog/categories/on-the-metal/), our 
podcast. You will not want to miss episodes of that! We have been lucky to 
have some amazing conversations with technologists, the first being 
[Jeff Rothschild](https://oxide.computer/blog/on-the-metal-1-jeff-rothschild/), 
and I can’t wait to share them with you! 

The past few months have been some of the most fun and rewarding of my entire 
career and we are only getting started. If you want to read more about some of 
the deep technical problems we will be solving check out my ACM Queue articles: 
[Open Source Firmware](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3349301) and 
[Opening up the Baseboard Management Controller](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3378404). 

We would love to have you join us in [our mission to “Kick butt, have fun, don't 
cheat, love our customers, change computing forever”](https://oxide.computer/principles/)
-- head over to [our careers page](https://oxide.computer/careers/) or if you 
are a designer who codes send us a [pull request](https://design.oxide.computer)!
If you are currently running on premises and are interested in what we are 
building, [join our mailing list](https://oxide.computer) and I will be in 
touch!

Thank you to all of our friends and family for their support of our endeavor. 
I, personally, could not have done this without your advice, guidance, and 
positivity during our fundraise and after. I've been waiting for the day I 
could share with everyone what we've been up to and I am beyond excited to 
build a company and a product people will love! Stay tuned!
