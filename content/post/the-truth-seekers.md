Last week I got to see what it was like to be an investigative journalist for
a day. It was thrilling. I will get into what I learned but first I waned to
give some background on why I was doing this.

I have a general curiosity for people. It's interesting to me to uncover what
people are motivated by. Humans are individual snowflakes and no one is exactly
like the next. It is our unique experiences that form the way we think and
behave, as well as what drives us.

It is in my nature to learn and absorb information. I also recently learned,
although I should have realized this throughout my life, I am well attuned to
absorbing others emotions. I think my deep drive for understanding others and
value of the truth is somewhat perfect for the role of "investigative
journalism".

Researching things for investigative journalism is very similar to that of
research for academia. Investigative journalism seems to be driven by
intuition, while academia might be more driven by novel research.

I got to see what [Jeff Kao](https://twitter.com/jeffykao)'s job was like for
a few hours and I learned a lot.

One of the more interesting things we discussed was diffs. I brought up if
diffs (as in those used by a source control tool) could work as a line of
truth. With a diff, the history of a document is fully transparent, anyone
can see any and all changes to it (of course taking into account, tracking
force pushes as well).

Jeff pointed out that there is past history of journalism using "diffs". One
example was from [an article](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/03/abortion-gun-laws-stand-your-ground-model-bills-conservatives-liberal-corporate-influence-lobbyists/3162173002/)
that uncovered bills and laws being copied and influenced by corporations. They
compared the text of the bills to others and showed the changes,
similarities, and motivations
behind them.

I then realized that Jeff was the author of the [amazing article](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6) from a couple
years ago on how net neutrality comments were likely faked. He used natural
language processing to find the similarities in the comments.

Both these articles use comparisons of text to uncover falsifications or
motivations. This is super similar to diffs, which is also a comparison of text! I also started thinking about how
in [my previous article](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/government-medicine-capitalism/)
I mentioned it would be cool if laws were versioned with git. By doing
that, we would get the diff and history of changes to the laws. Changes to laws
or language used over time could be visualized quite easily with the tools for
source control.

Overall, the day was fascinating. Investigative journalism was really aligned
with my joy of learning new things from a variety of different perspectives and
using intuition and research to try to find truth.

Another thought I have been thinking on is: how can we separate emotion from
the truth? So much of the news today is trying to trigger an emotional response
for clicks. Or in the worst case, it is trying to trigger an emotional response
for influencing an election. How can we promote the news sources that focus on
the truth versus triggering a reaction? The truth itself should be enough of
a trigger.
